Find a union of pizzerias that have orders from either women or men. In other words, you should find a set of names of pizzerias that have been ordered only by women and make "UNION" operation with set of names of pizzerias that have been ordered only by men. Please be careful with word "only" for both genders. For all SQL operators with sets don't store duplicates (`UNION`, `EXCEPT`, `INTERSECT`).  Please sort a result by the name of the pizzeria. The sample data is shown below.


| pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | 
| Papa Johns |
